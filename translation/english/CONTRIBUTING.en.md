## Link's Style

A link must to be added in your more authentic shape.
- You can't use link shortener.
- You can't use link redirect (even they're the same application).
- You can't use  affiliate link (or with tracking parameters).

To sustain the same pattern for all links, you must to:

- Add a title which matches with the title of the content in the link.
- Add a flag (Brazil, US, China) to represent the language of the content.
